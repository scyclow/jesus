      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>Some people find meaning in their life through collecting things. Some people find meaning in their lives through Jesus. From 2016 onwards it became possible to find meaning in life by collecting Jesus pamphlets.</p>
      <p>Many of these were added to my collection as I changed trains under Barclays Center. Among the chaos of commuters, a preacher wearing a suit and screaming about The Lord would sometimes be there waiting for me with a smile and a pamphlet. The anticipation would quickly build from the second we locked eyes, and as I cut through the traffic to meet him I was either rewarded with a rush of dopamine from having received a new pamphlet, or my anticipation fizzled out into disappointment as I realized I had this one already.</p>
      <p>As the collection took on more meaning in my life, I became acutely aware of stray lying on the sidewalk. People found the same glee in collecting pamphlets as I did with the sole intention of gifting them to me. I even began hunting down publishers and ordering some on the internet.</p>
      <p>But pamphlets sometimes come from other places: A thoughtful friend, an elderly Caribbean woman screaming gibberish on a subway car, or rummaging through boxes in the basement containing things past-me found amusing. Jesus pamphlets often come into your life in unexpected ways.</p>
      <p>Please click on these links to explore the website! View the collection, visit our metaverse location, or save an old pamphlet from purgatory!</p>
